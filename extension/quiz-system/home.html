      <h1>Spelling Test</h1>
      <p>Practice all the words in your word list here! To complete a word, get
        it correct three times in a row and it will be deleted from your word
        list. The bottom row will show all green when a word has been completed,
        and your streak indicator will show the number of words you have
        successfully completed during that session. You can skip words and come
        back to them in another session with skip button in the bottom left
        corner. Progress on completed words will not be lost if you leave the
        page.</p>
